# Verification-Driven Development (VDD)

Use this workflow for feature, bugfix, integration, deployment, and data-pipeline tasks where runtime behavior matters.

## Required operating loop
- Start with a compact joint plan: implementation steps plus executable verification steps.
- For each verification step, include exact command, execution location, and pass/fail signal.
- Implement minimal changes, run verification, inspect outputs, and fix failures iteratively.
- Do not claim completion without executed verification and observed evidence.

## Command ownership
- Run implementation and verification commands yourself whenever possible.
- Ask the human to run a command only when execution is genuinely impossible in-agent.
- If blocked, report the exact command, observed failure signal, and why human action is required.

## Evidence requirements
- Map each acceptance criterion to at least one artifact-backed signal.
- Include at least one correlation check (for example, input value to runtime output/log).
- Treat verification as an experiment: define `H1` (claim) vs `H0` (no change/plausible confounder) and use evidence/controls that can distinguish them.
- When evidence includes screenshots/images/video, use vision-based interpretation to extract semantic signals (not only pixel diffs) and tie them to an observable and decision rule.
- Treat vision-derived signals as heuristic proxies: corroborate with an independent signal when they affect the verdict; otherwise mark results as inconclusive.
- Prefer concrete evidence (structured metrics/tables/output excerpts) over plain assertions.
- Use ground-truth comparison when possible (trusted baseline, labeled data, or reference output).

## Final response requirements
- Provide one terminal state: `VERIFIED`, `READY FOR HUMAN VERIFICATION`, or `BLOCKED`.
- Include commands run, key evidence, artifact paths, and known gaps.
- By default, produce closeout artifact: markdown report (Verification Brief still required in final response).
- Validate report format before closeout (`scripts/validate-vdd-report.sh`) and fix errors first.
- If runtime verification is unavailable, request explicit approval before using static-only checks.
