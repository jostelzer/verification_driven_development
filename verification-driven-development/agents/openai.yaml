  default_prompt: "Use $verification-driven-development (VDD) to create a compact joint implementation and verification plan, choose a target evidence tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold), run executable checks, collect show-don't-tell evidence artifacts, and issue a final certificate only at terminal state, rendering the certificate inline in the final response. By default, generate closeout artifact as markdown report, render the Verification Brief directly in chat, and validate report format before closeout."
