  default_prompt: "Use $verification-driven-development (VDD) to create a compact joint implementation and verification plan, choose a target evidence tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold), design discriminating checks (H1 claim vs H0 no-change/confounder), run executable checks, collect show-don't-tell evidence artifacts, and issue a final certificate only at terminal state, rendering the certificate inline in the final response. When evidence includes screenshots/images/video, use vision-based interpretation to extract semantic observables (text, object state/position, UI state) rather than relying only on pixel diffs, tie the signal to a decision rule, and corroborate vision-derived signals when they are load-bearing. By default, generate closeout artifact as markdown report, render the Verification Brief directly in chat, and validate report format before closeout. If VDD tooling fails, switch to failover mode, include stack trace evidence, and generate a prefilled GitHub issue link/body via render-vdd-failover-issue.sh before returning BLOCKED."
