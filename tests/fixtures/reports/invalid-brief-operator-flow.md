## Verification Outcome

Status Badge: 🟨 READY FOR HUMAN VERIFICATION 🧑‍🔬

## Closeout Artifacts

- Report Markdown: .agent/runs/20260213-000100/verification-report.md

## Verification Brief Claim

UI interaction requires manual confirmation after automated backend checks passed.

## Verification Brief Evidence

- Backend API checks passed for all required request payloads.
- UI preflight dependencies installed and browser launch succeeded.
Graphic unavailable: fixture report omits images by design.

## Verification Brief How YOU Can Run This

```bash
node .agent/runs/20260213-000100/playwright_check.js
```

Pass signal: script prints success marker
Fail signal: script exits non-zero

## Goal

Validate checkout button visibility changes in UI flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Checkout button is hidden before terms are accepted.
- Checkout button appears after terms are accepted.

## What Changed

- Added UI guard for checkout button rendering.
- Wired guard to terms acceptance state.
- Added telemetry event for terms toggle.

## Runtime

- Execution context: local.
- Host: dev-macos.
- Versions: bash 5.x, node 20.x.

## Ground-Truth Plan and Data

- Target evidence tier: Gold, because full browser-path verification is estimated under 10 minutes.
- Achieved evidence tier: Silver, because manual click confirmation is still pending.
- Gold runtime estimate: 5m total.
- Gold decision gate: <=10m (auto-Gold).
- User tier choice when Gold >10m: n/a (Gold was mandatory).
- Source: prior stable UI behavior snapshots.
- Acquisition: compared runtime behavior against screenshot baseline.
- Sample size and selection: two deterministic interaction paths.
- Metrics and thresholds: visibility transition observed in both paths.
- Data/artifact location: .agent/runs/20260213-000100/ui-summary.md.
- Waiver (if any): none.

## Commands Run

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

## Results by Criterion

- Criterion: Checkout button hidden before terms acceptance.
- Result: PASS
- Evidence: UI assertion logs from run output.

- Criterion: Checkout button appears after terms acceptance.
- Result: PASS
- Evidence: UI assertion logs from run output.

## Verification Certificate

Status Badge: 🟨 READY FOR HUMAN VERIFICATION 🧑‍🔬
Verdict: READY FOR HUMAN VERIFICATION 🧑‍🔬
Task: validate checkout button visibility flow
What was empirically verified by agent: backend checks and UI preflight completed
Evidence gathered by agent: assertions and logs captured
Artifact index: .agent/runs/20260213-000100/ui-summary.md
Ground-Truth Gap: manual click confirmation still required
Why this is not yet conclusive: interactive UI review pending
Run this harness: node .agent/probes/ui/checkout-flow.js
Human checks:
- Confirm checkout button hidden before terms accepted
- Confirm checkout button visible after terms accepted
How human evidence will confirm completion: screenshot pair matches expected behavior

## Evidence and Inspection

- Signal 1: backend checks passed.
- Signal 2: UI preflight passed.
- Signal 3: no runtime errors in logs.

## Timing

- Estimated per-step + total: preflight 2m, UI test 3m, total 5m.
- Actual per-step + total: preflight 2m, UI test 3m, total 5m.
- Tier gate outcome: Gold mandatory (<=10m estimate).
- Note if actual total exceeded estimate and why: did not exceed estimate.

## Cleanup

- Resources started by verification: Playwright Chromium process tree and temporary local UI server.
- Teardown commands run: `pkill -f playwright`, `pkill -f ui-dev-server`.
- Post-cleanup check: `pgrep -f 'playwright|ui-dev-server'` returned no matches.
- Cleanup status: COMPLETE.

## Known Limits

Manual UI confirmation required for final acceptance.

## Final State

Final State: READY FOR HUMAN VERIFICATION 🧑‍🔬
