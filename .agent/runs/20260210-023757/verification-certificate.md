## Verification Certificate
Status Badge: 🟩 VERIFIED ✅ (GREEN FLAGS)
Verdict: VERIFIED ✅
Task: Make the VDD certificate user-visible in chat and add green-flag checkmarks to the VERIFIED template.
Revision: working tree (uncommitted)
Runtime: local
Green Flags:
- ✅ Ran `rg` to confirm inline-certificate instruction appears in `SKILL.md` and the evaluation checklist.
- ✅ Ran `rg` to confirm the VERIFIED template now includes Green Flags and the UI prompt mentions inline rendering.
Artifacts:
- /Users/jjj/git/verification_driven_development/.agent/runs/20260210-023757/rg-final-response.txt — shows the new inline-certificate requirement text.
Why this is convincing: The updated instructions and template lines are present in the exact files the agent reads for closeout behavior.
